# mini-Alpha-Go

Trying to implement a simplified version of AlphaGo (by "Google DeepMind") â€“ a computer program that uses the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm combined with a (not so) deep Convolutional Neural Network in order to play Connect4. (project A - technion - CONNECT4 version)


- board.py : A collection of classes and functions for playing certain types of games.
- connect_four.py : A simulator for playing Connect4 (mAlphaGo vs. standard MCTS).
- train_cnn.py : building an training the cnn (the 'mAlphaGo' player) using Tensorflow.

(disclaimer - The code is quite messy, largely uncommented, and intended mainly for reference)
